## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about a label that crosses out the text that is inside it, this to try to maintain semantics and accessibility since there is also the use of a css property called text-decoration: line-troughed, in addition to this I learned and it worked for me interesting the use of media queries with device orientation

```html
<s>$169.99</s>
```
```css
@media (min-width: 480px) and (orientation: landscape) {}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on the theme of elements and responsive sites, since I feel that it is difficult for me and I need to improve, in addition to mastering css in a general way and writing css and html code as clean as possible.

### Useful resources

- [Resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML/Element/s) - this helped me to understand the use of the tag to be able to maintain the semantics in HTML
